	to block in any way (for example, call xQueueReceive() with a block time
	specified, or call vTaskDelay()).  If the application makes use of the
	vTaskDelete() API function (as this demo application does) then it is also
	important that vApplicationIdleHook() is permitted to return to its calling
	function, because it is the responsibility of the idle task to clean up
